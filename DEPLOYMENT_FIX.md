# 🚨 Deployment Error Fix

## The Problem
You're getting an error because Streamlit Cloud is trying to run the wrong file. The error shows it's loading `api_optimized.py` instead of `streamlit_app.py`.

## ✅ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Your Streamlit Cloud Settings
1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Click on your app
3. Go to "Settings" or "Manage app"
4. Make sure the **Main file path** is set to: `streamlit_app.py`
5. Make sure the **Requirements file** is set to: `requirements_streamlit.txt`

### Step 2: Verify File Structure
Your repository should have this structure:
```
your-repo/
├── streamlit_app.py          ← MAIN FILE (not api_optimized.py)
├── requirements_streamlit.txt
├── saved_model/
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── model.safetensors
│   ├── vocab.txt
│   ├── tokenizer_config.json
│   └── special_tokens_map.json
└── .streamlit/
    └── config.toml
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. In Streamlit Cloud, click "Redeploy" or "Deploy"
2. Wait for the deployment to complete
3. Check the logs to make sure it's using `streamlit_app.py`

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Wrong Main File
**Error:** `File "/mount/src/sach/api_optimized.py"`
**Solution:** Change main file to `streamlit_app.py`

### Issue 2: Missing Model Files
**Error:** `FileNotFoundError: saved_model/`
**Solution:** Make sure all files in `saved_model/` are uploaded

### Issue 3: Requirements Issues
**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError`
**Solution:** Use `requirements_streamlit.txt` (not `requirements.txt`)
